shadow map snapping always

render shadow map msaa and resolve it?

try to faaa the shadow buffer

use texture2DShadow for free stuff including PCF, which I might not want and can disable I think

can probably fix the black background with a texture setting like clamp or limit the shader sample range

maybe you can nearest the PCF and optimize it

interweaved ssao noise for cache efficiency

try making ssao texture a power of 2 like 1024x512 and see how that goes

try making various textures sample nearest see how it affects performance and visuals

try making ssao rgba see what happens

try storing normals as half float or less 10 10 2 with reconstruction? idk

try storing position as a half float? it's just used for lighting...

actually if I can reconstruct position from depth is position used for anything at all?

try reconstruting position from depth for more cache hits and f32 depth vs rgba32 for position

allow locking world space resolution for the shadow buffer
locking dimensions would be based on the 3 frustrum dimensions + frustrum diagonal at depth

allow view direction lock for shadow matrix generation

allow light direction lock for shadow matrix generation

only fix world dimensions to direction locked boundaries if both locks are true

smaa

just smaa, good quality but not as fast
requires at least 3 passes

deferred msaa
https://mynameismjp.wordpress.com/2010/08/16/deferred-msaa/
probably wont antialias solid face colors or hard normals
uses legitimate hardware level subpixel multisampling
interpolates final aliased pixel value based on subpixel depth sampling I think

faaa
https://github.com/grebord/Fast-Adaptive-AA
faster than low quality smaa
much visually better than traditional fxaa, similar to smaa

lxaa
https://github.com/grebord/LXAA-Antialiasing-Shader
based on timothy lottes console fxaa v3
maybe similar speed to fxaa? very low blurring
uses similar edge detesction as faaa but lower quality and faster
