shadow map snapping

smaa
https://github.com/iryoku/smaa
just smaa, good quality but not as fast
requires at least 3 passes

deferred msaa
https://mynameismjp.wordpress.com/2010/08/16/deferred-msaa/
probably wont antialias solid face colors or hard normals
uses legitimate hardware level subpixel multisampling
interpolates final aliased pixel value based on subpixel depth sampling I think

faaa
https://github.com/grebord/Fast-Adaptive-AA
faster than low quality smaa
much visually better than traditional fxaa, similar to smaa

lxaa
https://github.com/grebord/LXAA-Antialiasing-Shader
based on timothy lottes console fxaa v3
maybe similar speed to fxaa? very low blurring
uses similar edge detesction as faaa but lower quality and faster
